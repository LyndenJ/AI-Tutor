# AI-Tutor

This was a project for UAlberta student group Enactus' Ultimate Pitch 2023 and was presented to a panel of judges. The idea was to showcase some of the possibilities that AI models bring to the table. In this case
I wanted to demonstrate how an AI model similar to GPT-3 could be used as a study tool. This particular app calls GPT-3's API as well as AWS's Polly for text to speech, but the idea is that in
the future, another AI model (particularly trained on school material i.e textbooks, notes, papers, exams, practice problems, essays, rubrics, etc ...) with text to speech capabilities and maybe 
even speech to animation capabilities can deliver course material to student who are looking for extra resources.

I programmed this demo, but would like to thank Maverick Schroeder for his help with the Enactus presentation. AI Tutor will be back in 2024!!

Here is a photo of an example output when the program was asked to generate a Fluid Mechanics practice question:
